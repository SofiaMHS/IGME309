	For this exercise, the main issue I struggled with was the formatting of the Javascript WebGL setup. This was mainly because the tutorial I was following did not include the necessary head content which enabled this tool. While all the content within the scripts was correct, it was difficult to see what exactly I had done wrong, as Visual Code’s autofill didn’t account for WebGL content. This required me to be more attentive to what I was writing, as well as how I was going through the tutorial.   
Other than those issues, I didn’t find myself struggling much with the rest of the assignment, as the drawing of the triangle itself was rather simple. However, working with WebGL for the first time was an interesting experience, as I needed to go back and reread certain parts of the tutorials I followed, in order to fully understand how things like the graphics pipeline works. Overall, I found this to be an interesting exploration of WebGL concepts through Javascript.
